1. Yes, you should use unit testing to test the messaging feature of a messaging application. Unit testing can verify that the sender and the recipient of the message are who they are supposed to be, and that the content that you send in the message is actually in the message like you want it to be.
2. Yes, you should also use unit testing to test the max message length feature of the messaging application. This can make sure that it works for all of the message lengths supported (either 0 to 80 or 1 to 80), and that it does not support any messages more than 80.
